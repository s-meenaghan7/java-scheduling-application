This Java application is used to keep track of customer information and their appointments for a consulting company specializing in two separate service types: project management and financial consulting. The application connects to a MySQL database to retrieve relevant data regarding customer and appointment information. User login data (credentials) is also held in the database. Data access objects (DAO) are responsible for performing CRUD operations on the database tables to create, retrieve, update, and delete information used in the application.
