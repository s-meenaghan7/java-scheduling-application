# Appointment Scheduling System
Timekeeping/appointment scheduling system built for a fictitious consulting company, written in Java.

---

This Java application is used to keep track of customer information and their appointments for a company. The application connects to a MySQL database to retrieve relevant data regarding customer and appointment information. User login data (credentials) is also held in the database. Data access objects are responsible for performing CRUD operations on the database's tables to create, retrieve, update, and delete information used in the application.

todo: implement all the other controllers and views, refactor their code so it can run, and test.
    Go over code base and refactor as needed. Then complete this README.
